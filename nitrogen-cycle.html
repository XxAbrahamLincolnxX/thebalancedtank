                <h2>What is the nitrogen cycle?</h2>
                <p>In a closed aquarium, fish waste, uneaten food, and plant matter produce <strong>ammonia</strong>, which is toxic to fish. The nitrogen cycle is the process that turns that ammonia into less harmful compounds.</p>
                <p>Beneficial bacteria that grow in the filter and on surfaces in the tank do the work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ammonia</strong> (NH₃) — from waste and decay — is converted to <strong>nitrite</strong> (NO₂⁻) by one group of bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrite</strong> is still toxic. A second group of bacteria converts it to <strong>nitrate</strong> (NO₃⁻).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrate</strong> is much less harmful at low levels. You keep it in check with regular water changes and, in planted tanks, plants use some of it as fertilizer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Until these bacteria colonies are established, ammonia and nitrite can spike and harm or kill fish. That’s why “cycling” the tank before adding livestock is so important.</p>

                <h2>Set up the environment before adding living creatures</h2>
                <p>Adding fish or other animals to a brand‑new tank is risky. The filter and surfaces don’t yet have enough beneficial bacteria to handle waste, so ammonia and nitrite can rise quickly and poison the inhabitants.</p>
                <p><strong>Cycling</strong> means running the tank (with a source of ammonia, such as a small amount of fish food or pure ammonia) for several weeks so that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacteria that convert ammonia → nitrite can grow.</li>
                    <li>Bacteria that convert nitrite → nitrate can grow.</li>
                    <li>You see ammonia and nitrite rise, then fall to zero (or near zero), with nitrate present — that’s when the cycle is established.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only after the cycle is complete and you’ve confirmed with a test kit should you add fish or other livestock. Doing this first keeps the environment safe and reduces stress and loss.</p>

                <h2>Test the water regularly</h2>
                <p>Even in a cycled tank, things can change: overfeeding, new fish, or a filter problem can cause ammonia or nitrite to appear again. Regular testing lets you catch problems early and keep the environment as healthy as possible.</p>
                <p>Test at least:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ammonia</strong> — should be 0 (or undetectable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrite</strong> — should be 0 (or undetectable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nitrate</strong> — keep it low (e.g. under 20–40 ppm depending on stock); water changes are the main way to reduce it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>During cycling, test every few days so you can see the cycle progress. In an established tank, testing weekly (or after any change) is a good habit. A simple liquid test kit is accurate and lasts a long time — it’s one of the best investments for your tank’s health.</p>
